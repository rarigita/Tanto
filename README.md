Factoring algorithms and research since 2003. Latex, c++, maple, pdf and ps files.
* **ukc.pdf**: is my ma600 dissertation on Factoring Large Integers where I analyse and code the most important factoring algorithms to date, written in 2003 at the University of Kent.

* **code**: folder contains c++ source code and compiled programs of each of the algorithms explained on the pdf.

* **mws.xxx**: folders contains maple source files that I wrote to play around with new ideas and paths to solve the factoring problem. I wrote very interesting maple procedures to play around both with Maple and new ideas.
